# My Learning Self Reflection

My self reflection on my learning after our first 4 sessions on the Coding Black Females x UBS Entry To Tech Bootcamp 2024.

## What I have learnt so far:
* How to use the command line and some of the most common commands, for example:
  * pwd, ls, ls -a
  * mkdir directory_name
  * rm -r directory_name
  * touch file_name
  * mv directory_name new_directory_name
* How to navigate around directories using pathways, for example:
  * cd ../
* The concept and purpose of Git version control  
* How to initialise a Git repository
* How to create and checkout to different branches
* How to add files to the staging area and commit changes to the repo
* Git best practices, for example:
  * working on new features on branches as opposed to the main branch
  * making small and frequent commits with meaningful commit messages
  * using a consistent tense for commit messages 
* Markdown and the purpose of READMEs
* Using GitHub to host a remote repo for collaborative working
* How to merge two (or more) branches
* How to fork and clone repos from GitHub to my local machine

## What I am still confused about
* I am still unsure I fully understand how and when to safely use the following commands linking my local repo with a remote repo:
   * git push
   * git fetch
   * git merge
   * git pull (a combination of git fetch and git merge in one step)

## What I am looking forward to next on the course
* Getting started with Java basics
